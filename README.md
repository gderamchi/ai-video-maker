## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Netlify account
- Blackbox API key

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd ai-video-maker-1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   BLACKBOX_API=your_blackbox_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run locally with Netlify Dev**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The site will be available at `http://localhost:8888`

## 📦 Deployment to Netlify

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify CLI

1. **Install Netlify CLI** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```

3. **Initialize and deploy**
   ```bash
   netlify init
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy via Netlify Dashboard

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings (should auto-detect from `netlify.toml`)

3. **Set Environment Variable**
   - In Netlify Dashboard, go to: Site settings → Environment variables
   - Add new variable:
     - **Key**: `BLACKBOX_API`
     - **Value**: Your Blackbox API key

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Your site will be live at `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)

The project includes a `netlify.toml` file with the following settings:

- **Publish directory**: Root directory (`.`)
- **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`
- **Node version**: 18
- **Function timeout**: 10 seconds (adjust if needed)

### API Configuration

The Blackbox API is configured to use:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.blackbox.ai/chat/completions`
- **Model**: `blackboxai/google/veo-3`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (from `BLACKBOX_API` environment variable)

```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Upload Photos**: Users upload one or more photos through the drag-and-drop interface
2. **Write Prompt**: Users describe the desired video in the text area
3. **Generate**: Click "Generate Video" to send the request
4. **Processing**: 
   - Frontend sends photos (as base64) and prompt to Netlify function
   - Netlify function calls Blackbox API with Veo 3 model
   - API processes the request and generates video
5. **Display**: Generated video is displayed with download option

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Netlify Serverless Functions (Node.js 18+)
- **AI Model**: Blackbox AI - Veo 3
- **Hosting**: Netlify
- **API**: Blackbox API (native fetch, no external dependencies)

## 🔐 Security

- API keys are stored securely in Netlify environment variables
- Never exposed to the client-side code
- All API calls are proxied through serverless functions

## 📝 Usage Tips

- **Photo Quality**: Use high-quality images for best results
- **Prompt Details**: Be specific about transitions, effects, mood, and style
- **Multiple Photos**: The AI will use all uploaded photos in sequence
- **Creative Freedom**: No content restrictions - describe exactly what you want

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 500 Internal Server Error
**FIXED in v1.1:** Removed node-fetch dependency, now using native fetch API
- If you still see this error, check `BLACKBOX_API` is set in Netlify
- Redeploy after setting environment variable
- See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for detailed solutions

### 401 Unauthorized Error
**This is normal** if using placeholder API key
- Get real API key from https://www.blackbox.ai/
- Update `BLACKBOX_API` environment variable
- Redeploy the site

### API Key Issues
- Ensure `BLACKBOX_API` is set in Netlify environment variables
- Verify the API key starts with `sk-`
- Verify the API key is valid and has proper permissions

### Function Timeout / 500 Errors
**Important**: Netlify free tier has a **26-second maximum timeout** for serverless functions. Video generation with Blackbox API typically takes 30-60 seconds, which exceeds this limit.

**Solutions:**
1. **Upgrade to Netlify Pro** ($19/month) - Allows up to 26 seconds timeout (still may not be enough)
2. **Use a different deployment platform**:
   - Vercel (60-second timeout on free tier)
   - Railway (no timeout limits)
   - AWS Lambda (15-minute timeout)
3. **Try veo-2 model** (may be faster than veo-3-fast)
4. **Implement async/polling** (complex, requires database)

**Current Status**: The code is correct, but Netlify's timeout limitation prevents it from working on the free tier.

### Photo Upload Issues
- Ensure photos are in supported formats (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- Check file sizes aren't too large (recommended < 5MB each)
