### Option 2: Deploy via Netlify CLI

   ```

## Getting Your Blackbox API Key

1. Visit [Blackbox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to API settings or developer dashboard
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key (it should start with 'sk-')

## Verify Deployment

After deployment, test your site:

1. **Visit your site URL**
2. **Upload a test photo**
3. **Enter a prompt** (e.g., "Create a smooth video transition")
4. **Click "Generate Video"**
5. **Check the result**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "API key not configured"
- **Solution**: Ensure `BLACKBOX_API` is set in Netlify environment variables
- Redeploy after setting the variable

### Issue: "Authentication Error"
- **Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and starts with 'sk-'
- Check if the key has proper permissions

### Issue: Function timeout
- **Solution**: Increase timeout in `netlify.toml` (max 10s for free tier)
- Consider upgrading to Pro plan for longer timeouts

### Issue: Large photo uploads fail
- **Solution**: Compress photos before upload
- Recommended max size: 5MB per photo

2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
